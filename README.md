This code is developed by Yuchen Ge and Zhiping Zhang from Northwestern Polytechnical University(NPU), and it was named as FCSADA (Fast Calculation Software for Aircraft Design and Analysis) by authors. The authors wish that the FCSADA can provide a framework for the aircraft design especially in aerodynamic design, gravimetric analysis, structure design, performance analysis, stability analysis and so on.
